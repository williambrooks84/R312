          <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the
            impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down
            among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
            noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
            indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his
            own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an
            eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell
            in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh,
            would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within
            me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p>

        <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
          greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun
          strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
          inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the

          <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced the Rebel
          spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

          <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span

            let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all
            clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
          <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to
            will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking,
          seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.
          There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

          <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and
            the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the pit,
            advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a
            white flag.</p>

          <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
            horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
            belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
            seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>

          <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
            "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too
            small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
            table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
            illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur
            boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
            Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p>
